# Intro

This plugin forms part of a series of related plugins that allow Agora affiliates to interact with the middleware 2 REST api.

By itself this plugin doesn't really do anything, it just gives you a place to save some settings and change some text variables. You'll need other plugins in the series to really get stuck in.

If you have access to the Github repo for this or related plugins you are asked to report bugs using the issue tracker. You are also encouraged to submit your own contributions via pull-requests

# Quick Start


Grab a copy the plugin by cloning this repository, or downloading the Zip file. Full [installation instructions can be found here](https://github.com/Pubsvs/Middleware-Base/wiki/Installation). **It is highly recommended that you clone the repository to make it easier to pull updates in the future.**

[The debug plugin](https://github.com/Pubsvs/Middleware-Debug) is a good place to start. It doesn't do anything to the front end of your site and gives you a screen in wordpress where you can see data coming back from middleware. It can even be used with the old Crowd Favorite plugin installed.
