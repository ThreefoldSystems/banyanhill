=== Agora Middleware 2.x Base Plugin ===

Provides a connection layer for Agora Middleware 2.0, and an admin interface for configuration

== Description ==

This plugin forms part of a series of related plugins that allow Agora affiliates to interact with the middleware 2 REST api.

By itself this plugin doesn't really do anything, it just gives you a place to save some settings and change some text variables. You'll need other plugins in the series to really get stuck in.

If you have access to the Github repo for this or related plugins you are asked to report bugs using the issue tracker. You are also encouraged to submit your own contributions via pull-requests.
